        Thanks for downloading the app and giving it a try!\n
        \n
        Here are some useful tips while using the app:\n
        * If you select a Speedrun to watch, your progress is automatically recorded. Feel free
        to leave and come back later!\n
        * Filters can be used on any leaderboard. Your filter options are saved for next time.\n
        * You can subscribe to categories and players to be notified of a new PB/WR.\n
        * Charts are available for the site, games, categories/levels, and players. Just click the graph icon.\n
        * Want to watch speedruns on your TV? This app is available for Android TV or Amazon Fire TV (currently in beta).\n
        \n
        This project started in March 2019 out of my distaste for viewing the Speedrun.com website directly from
        a phone. While the site is mobile friendly, it lacks some useful features normally found on
        smartphones. I continue to supply bugfixes and new features for this app almost every month.\n
        \n
        If you like the app, please consider supporting my motivation by sharing or rating.

        I know its been awhile! This release was created to address some issues with the growing
        size of leaderboards and some player record pages. Specifically:\n
        * Partial loading of leaderboards which are very, very long\n
        * Paginated loading of player pages and regrouping\n
        * Server side improvements to signficiantly reduce costs and improve performance\n

        I do my best to track, monitor, and resolve crashes and other app misbehavior as are observable via
        analytics. However, I have had a lot of difficulty resolving some issues reported on the Play Store
        because I have not been able to open a line of communication or receive more specific details of the
        issue.\n
        \n
        In order to resolve this, this project uses GitHub Issues to track problems and communicate issues.
        To submit an issue, you must have a GitHub account.\n
        \n
        If you choose to submit an issue, the process would be made easier if you include:\n
        \n
        * Screenshots of issues and pages around the issue, when applicable\n
        * A detailed overview of your session, including which games, players, and runs you may have viewed
