    <string name="dialog_msg_release_notes">
        Ever since I started writing this app, I have always wanted to do more with the data
        this app interacts with. This release includes the introduction of charts-a major step
        in accomplishing this goal.\n
        \n
        Here are the charts to look for:\n
        * World record progression, as seen on speedrun.com. Includes the ability to view as part of
        a list and view the videos for all the runs!\n
        * Submission volume-for all of the above :)\n
        * Player\'s "favorite" games based on PB submissions\n
        * All time runs submitted to the site (also as seen on speedrun.com)\n
        \n
        Coming soon:\n
        * Player PBs chart\n
        * Biggest improvers and new contenders for the WR in a game/category\n
        * Longest world record holders\n
        This is just the beginning. I plan to continue adding new charts regularly as they come
        to mind/are suggested.\n
        \n
        It has been really great to see this project grow. Thanks for all the support!

        I do my best to track, monitor, and resolve crashes and other app misbehavior as are observable via
        analytics. However, I have had a lot of difficulty resolving some issues reported on the Play Store
        because I have not been able to open a line of communication or receive more specific details of the
        issue.\n
        \n
        In order to try and remedy this, I recommend sending an email with an attached screenshot and details
        about your session so I can debug with greatest efficiency.\n
        \n
        You are of course welcome to post a poor review on the play store. I read feedback from there as well!
        I just will have a harder time resolving such issues.\n
        \n
        If you do choose to send an email, the process would be made most easy if you did the following:\n
        \n
        * Submit Screenshots of issues and pages around the issue, when applicable\n
        * Provide a detailed overview of your session, including which games, players, and runs you may have viewed
