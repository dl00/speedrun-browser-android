        Hi, and thanks for being one of the first people to use this app!\n
        \n
        There were a variety of simple and small issues fixed, but under the hood nearly every line of code has changed (both client and server) with this release.
        New features you can expect within the coming weeks:\n
        * Speedrun statistics and graphs like those shown on speedrun.com\n
        * Splits information for runs, when available\n
        * More subscription options\n
        \n
        Enjoy and please use the complain button in the About page if you run into any issues!

        I do my best to track, monitor, and resolve crashes and other app misbehavior as are observable via
        analytics. However, I have had a lot of difficulty resolving some issues reported on the Play Store
        because I have not been able to open a line of communication or receive more specific details of the
        issue.\n
        \n
        In order to try and remedy this, I recommend sending an email with an attached screenshot and details
        about your session so I can debug with greatest efficiency.\n
        \n
        You are of course welcome to post a poor review on the play store. I read feedback from there as well!
        I just will have a harder time resolving such issues.\n
        \n
        If you do choose to send an email, the process would be made most easy if you did the following:\n
        \n
        * Submit Screenshots of issues and pages around the issue, when applicable\n
        * Provide a detailed overview of your session, including which games, players, and runs you may have viewed
