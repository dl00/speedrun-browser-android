        Thanks for being one of the first to use this app!\n
        \n
        There are some new features you should know:\n
        * Watch history is now able to bring you to recently watched runs\n
        * You can now receive push notifications when a runner posts a new
          personal best. Just click the star on the player\'s page.\n
        \n
        More new features are coming down the pipe
        to subscribe to games and browse subscriptions. Should be ready in a couple weeks.\n
        \n
        As always, feel free to submit feedback through the Play Store
        or through the thread on the Speedrun.com forum. It\'s really appreciated!
